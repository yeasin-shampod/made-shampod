## Title
Air Quality Analysis in Major North American Cities with the Rise of Electric Vehicles

## Main Question

How has air quality in major North American cities changed with the rise of electric vehicles?
This is already well-phrased. Ensure it's focused and measurable with the data you have.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to evaluate the relationship between changes in air quality in major North American cities and the use of electric vehicles. The project will look into trends and effects using historical electric vehicle registration data and EPA's open-source air quality data. To find important changes and establish patterns, the study will employ statistical analysis and visualization techniques. The results can shed light on how environmentally friendly behaviors enhance environmental health.
